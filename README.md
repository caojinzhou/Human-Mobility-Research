# Human-Mobility-Research - Research on complex systems of human mobility

This was a research project to understand the scaling (exponent) of human mobility patterns, especially in cities.

Previous research using Big Data (twitter and related social media) was not able to discuss urban scale (anywhere near 10km) mobility patterns.

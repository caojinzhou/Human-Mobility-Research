Parameter:   

  Trip Lengths (auto, bicycle)


Expectation:

  Best Fit by normal distribution (naive assumption)


Why:

The individual picks a distance to travel, drawn from a uniform distribution and maximum distance according to mode velocity.

They then pick another distance to travel, also drawn from uniform.   
This second trip is independent from the first, and drawn from the same uniform distribution.

This process repeats.

Since these trips are i.i.d., the mean should be distributed normally.



Measured:

  Initially using built-in fitting tools of R or other high-level software.


Result, why/why not agree with expectation?

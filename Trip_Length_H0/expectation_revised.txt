**** Parameter:   

  Trip Lengths (km) for auto, bicycle


**** Expectation:

  Best Fit by normal distribution (H0: naive assumption)

  The auto trips should have a significantly longer mean than trips using bicycle.


**** Why:

The individual picks a distance to travel, drawn from a uniform distribution and maximum distance according to mode velocity.

They then pick another distance to travel, also drawn from uniform.   
This second trip is independent from the first, and drawn from the same uniform distribution.

This process repeats.

Since these trips are i.i.d., the mean should be distributed normally.



**** Measured:

  Initially using built-in fitting tools of R or other high-level software.


**** Result, why/why not agree with expectation?


Trip lengths were NOT normally distributed.  

This was shown by the Q-Q plots, which were highly skewed, and by the trip length plots, which were highly non-normal, as well as fitting results (below).


It is unlikely that trips of different lengths are chosen with a uniform distribution.

It is more likely that trips to inelastic destinations are chosen, and that other trips originate from those locations (home, work) due to 
a variety of factors (friendships, density of destinations, proximity, infrastructure networks, finite time, and many others).

Density of destinations probably plays a key role, and this density is very non-linear.

Also, it is unlikely that all trip lengths are independent.  
For example, if I have a common commute from home to work, then trips of that length will appear with a certain frequency.


As expected, the mean trip length for auto was significantly longer than for bicycle.

0:  Goal:

 To understand how three phenomena are modeled by random processes:
   - number of trips & inter-event time
   - trip length
   - trip duration

 To understand the effect of categorical variables, particularly transportation mode.



I. Questions:

- When are various measure distributions 'stationary'?

    - I.e. when are they not a function of absolute time?

    - Is this well-answered by auto-correlation at different time scales?
    - Do wavelets contribute to this answer?

- How do the measures look when they are stationary?

- Are the measures well-modeled by Poisson processes? (H0)
    (i.e. is inter-event time well-fit by exponential?)

    - If not, by what are they best modeled? (H_A)
      (It may be that event frequency is well-modeled by one process, while trip length, trip duration are well-modeled by another.)

- Can we see how the measures vary _for different modes_ during the various stationary periods?

  


II. For each time scale:

- month
- week
- day
- hour

Divide the time-scale into several (~5) sub-periods




III. Plot and Fit the following in each of the sub-periods (just use all_modes) 

- number of trip beginnings: mean/period SD/period (histogram of number of trips in each period)
- event auto-correlation:  lags at scale
- inter-event time distribution:  linear pdf, cdf of inter-event time
- trip length: log-log ccdf of trip length
- trip duration:  log-log ccdf




IV. Exact Procedure

*** Two important scales are day and hour. ***

Day:  Due to day-of-week effects.

We are interested in day-of-week, so we want to divide the data into several sections this way.

- pdf of trips/day for each day of week
- auto-correlation of events: lags at day scale to reveal cycles
- inter-event time PDF, CDF for each day of week
- trip length log-log CCDF for each day of week
- trip duration log-log CCDF for each day of week
- fit all above curves

Hour:  Due to the daily variation (night vs. day)

We are interested in hour-of-day, so we divide the data this way.

- pdf of trips/hour for each fifth of day by hours (24/5 ~ 5 hours)
- auto-correlation of events: lags at hour scale to reveal cycles
- inter-event time PDF, CDF for each fifth of day
- trip length log-log CCDF for each fifth of day
- trip duration log-log CCDF for each fifth of day
- fit all above curves


Week (and Month):  Due to the apparent variance of number of samples over the entire period.

For now, we will just look at week instead of month, since they aren't that different in magnitude.
- pdf of trips/week for each of sub-periods
- auto-correlation of events: lags at week scale
- inter-event time linear PDF, CDF for each fifth of entire period (not week-of-month for now)
- trip length log-log CCDF for each fifth of total period
- trip duration log-log CCDF for each fifth of total period
- fit all above curves




V.  Further questions:

- Ask same questions as above by categorical variable rather than time periods.  (i.e. stationarity over categories)

- Can non-stationary components (i.e. periodic/cyclic signal components) be filtered out to reveal stationary components?
  For example, using moving average.

- Can the relation between trip length and trip duration (and perhaps event frequency and inter-event time) be described by diffusion?

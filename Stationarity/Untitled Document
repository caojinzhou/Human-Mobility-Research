Stationarity



Stationary - the distribution of arrivals seens from time t does not depend on t:

E(F{t_n, y_n}) = E[F({t_n - t, y_n})]

[source: Stochastic Networks and Queues]



i.e. the distribution is independent of time.

"truly stationary" - all moments remain the same over time

"weakly stationary" - constant mean and ACF 

How to test stationarity statistically?

- parametric - "runs test"

- non-parametric - autocorrelation function dies off extremely slowly

-----
To do:

- generate sample data

- Use KPSS test (R)
